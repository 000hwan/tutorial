## Running Locally

For completeness, there are three primary ways of running tests locally.

- appium ruby console
- rake
- flake

Running locally means both the test and the virtual device are on your
computer. Manually running the console, rake, or flake is nice for
development. However to run the tests automatically, a continuous integration
solution is needed. That's what we're discussing in the next lesson.
